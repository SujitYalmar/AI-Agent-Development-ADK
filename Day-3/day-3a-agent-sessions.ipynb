This is one of the hottest areas where AI is making a tangible impact. Here's a breakdown of some of the key recent advancements:\n\n**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n\n*   **De Novo Drug Design:** Instead of screening existing libraries of compounds, generative AI models (like GANs, VAEs, and increasingly, diffusion models) can now **design entirely new molecules from scratch** that are optimized for specific properties like binding affinity to a target protein, solubility, and low toxicity. This is a huge leap forward, allowing for the exploration of chemical space that was previously inaccessible.\n*   **Target-Specific Molecule Generation:** Researchers can now feed AI models information about a specific disease target (e.g., a protein involved in cancer) and ask the AI to design molecules that are predicted to bind to and modulate that target.\n*   **Examples:** Companies like **Exscientia**, **Insilico Medicine**, and **Recursion Pharmaceuticals** are at the forefront, with some of their AI-designed drug candidates already progressing through preclinical and even early clinical trials.\n\n**2. AI for Predicting Drug Efficacy and Toxicity:**\n\n*   **In Silico Screening:** AI models can predict how well a potential drug candidate will interact with its target and its likely efficacy much earlier in the process, saving significant time and resources that would otherwise be spent on costly lab experiments.\n*   **Toxicity Prediction:** AI is becoming increasingly good at predicting potential adverse side effects and toxicity of drug candidates before they are even tested in animals or humans. This helps to de-risk the development process and prioritize safer compounds.\n*   **Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) Modeling:** AI can help predict how a drug will be absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted in the body (PK) and its effects on the body (PD), leading to better dosing strategies and understanding of drug behavior.\n\n**3. AI in Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **Uncovering New Disease Targets:** AI can analyze vast datasets of genomic, proteomic, transcriptomic, and clinical data to identify novel biological targets that are implicated in diseases but might have been overlooked by traditional research methods.\n*   **Prioritizing Targets:** AI can help researchers prioritize which targets are most promising for therapeutic intervention based on their biological relevance, druggability, and potential impact.\n\n**4. AI for Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n\n*   **Finding New Uses for Old Drugs:** AI algorithms can analyze the known properties of existing approved drugs and screen them against new disease targets to identify potential new therapeutic uses. This is often a faster and less risky path to market than developing a completely new drug.\n\n**5. Advancements in Data Integration and Analysis:**\n\n*   **Multi-Omics Integration:** AI is crucial for integrating and making sense of complex \"omics\" data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) from various sources. This holistic view provides a deeper understanding of disease mechanisms and potential drug intervention points.\n*   **Real-World Evidence (RWE) Analysis:** AI is being used to analyze RWE from electronic health records, insurance claims, and patient registries to understand drug effectiveness and safety in real-world settings, which can inform drug development and post-market surveillance.\n\n**6. Automation in High-Throughput Screening (HTS):**\n\n*   **Smart Screening:** AI is guiding HTS processes, making them more efficient by intelligently selecting which compounds to test and analyzing the results in real-time to guide further experiments.\n\n**Key Trends and What to Watch For:**\n\n*   **The Rise of AI-Native Drug Discovery Companies:** A growing number of biotech startups are built from the ground up around AI platforms.\n*   **Increased Collaboration:** Pharmaceutical giants are increasingly partnering with or acquiring AI-focused companies.\n*   **More AI-Designed Drugs Entering Clinical Trials:** We're seeing more and more drug candidates that have been discovered or designed using AI entering human trials.\n*   **Focus on Specific Disease Areas:** While AI is broadly applicable, there's significant progress in areas like oncology, rare diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders.\n\nIn summary, AI is fundamentally transforming drug discovery from a slow, serendipitous, and often trial-and-error process into a more rational, predictive, and accelerated endeavor. The ability of AI to sift through massive datasets, identify complex patterns, and design novel molecules is leading to a new era of pharmaceutical innovation.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're likely referring to the second development I mentioned in the previous response, which was **AI for Predicting Drug Efficacy and Toxicity**. This is a crucial area because it directly addresses some of the biggest bottlenecks and failure points in traditional drug discovery.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into how AI is revolutionizing this aspect:\n\n**The Problem AI is Solving:**\n\n*   **High Failure Rates:** A staggering number of drug candidates that enter preclinical and clinical trials fail, often due to lack of efficacy or unexpected toxicity. This leads to wasted time, immense financial costs, and delays in getting effective treatments to patients.\n*   **Time-Consuming and Expensive Experiments:** Traditional methods for evaluating efficacy and toxicity involve extensive laboratory experiments, animal testing, and early-stage human trials, which are all resource-intensive.\n*   **Difficulty Predicting Human Response:** Animal models, while valuable, don't always perfectly predict how a drug will behave in humans.\n\n**How AI is Making a Difference:**\n\n1.  **In Silico Efficacy Prediction (Virtual Screening and SAR):**\n    *   **Predictive Models:** AI algorithms, particularly machine learning models, are trained on vast datasets of known drug-target interactions, compound properties, and their observed effects in biological assays.\n    *   **Virtual Screening:** These models can then predict the likelihood of a novel compound binding to a specific disease target and eliciting a desired therapeutic effect. This allows researchers to prioritize compounds that show the highest predicted efficacy *before* expensive lab experiments.\n    *   **Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR) Analysis:** AI can help understand the complex relationship between a drug's chemical structure and its biological activity (both desired and undesired). This helps in optimizing lead compounds for better efficacy.\n\n2.  **Predictive Toxicology (Safety First):**\n    *   **Early Toxicity Flags:** AI models can identify chemical structures or compound properties that are often associated with toxicity. This allows researchers to flag and potentially discard problematic compounds very early in the discovery pipeline.\n    *   **Specific Toxicity Predictions:** AI can be trained to predict specific types of toxicity, such as cardiotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, genotoxicity, or neurotoxicity, based on chemical structure and historical data.\n    *   **Mechanism of Toxicity Identification:** In some cases, AI can even help infer the potential biological mechanisms by which a compound might cause harm, guiding further investigation.\n    *   **Reducing Animal Testing:** By accurately predicting toxicity in silico, AI can potentially reduce the reliance on animal testing, which is ethically sensitive and often has limited translational value.\n\n3.  **Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) Modeling:**\n    *   **ADMET Prediction:** AI is used to predict Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) properties of drug candidates. These properties are critical for determining how a drug behaves in the body and whether it will reach its target at sufficient concentrations.\n    *   **Dose Optimization:** By understanding PK/PD profiles, AI can help researchers predict optimal dosing regimens for clinical trials, increasing the chances of success and minimizing adverse events.\n\n4.  **Integration with Experimental Data:**\n    *   **Active Learning:** AI models can be used in an \"active learning\" loop. They make predictions, the predictions are tested experimentally, and the experimental results are fed back into the AI model to refine its accuracy. This iterative process significantly speeds up learning and optimization.\n    *   **Hypothesis Generation:** AI can analyze complex biological data and generate hypotheses about why a drug might be effective or toxic, guiding further experimental validation.\n\n**Examples and Impact:**\n\n*   **Reducing Attrition Rates:** The ultimate goal is to significantly reduce the number of drug candidates that fail in later stages of development, saving billions of dollars annually.\n*   **Faster Drug Development:** By identifying promising candidates and weeding out poor ones early, AI accelerates the entire drug discovery timeline.\n*   **Safer Drugs:** Proactive identification of toxicity means developing drugs with better safety profiles for patients.\n\n**Challenges and Future Directions:**\n\n*   **Data Quality and Quantity:** The accuracy of AI models heavily relies on the quality and volume of training data.\n*   **Interpretability:** While some AI models are more interpretable than others, understanding *why* an AI predicts a certain efficacy or toxicity can still be a challenge.\n*   **External Validation:** Models need to be rigorously validated on independent datasets to ensure they generalize well.\n*   **Integration with Human Data:** Bridging the gap between preclinical predictions and human clinical outcomes remains an ongoing area of research.\n\nIn essence, AI-powered efficacy and toxicity prediction is moving drug discovery towards a more data-driven, predictive, and risk-averse paradigm, ultimately aiming to bring safer and more effective medicines to patients faster.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The landscape of companies involved in AI-driven drug efficacy and toxicity prediction is diverse, encompassing large pharmaceutical companies, dedicated AI drug discovery startups, and contract research organizations (CROs).

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
