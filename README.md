# 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course — Google × Kaggle  
### Hands-on with the Agent Development Kit (ADK) + Gemini Models  

A complete collection of notebooks, code samples, and multi-agent workflows built during the 5-day intensive by Google & Kaggle.  
This repository includes day-wise learning material, whitepapers, codelabs, and agent implementations covering foundations → tools → memory → evaluation → productionization.

## 🧪 How to Use the Notebooks

- Start with Day 1 folder to understand agent foundations.

- Explore each notebook sequentially (Day 1 → Day 5).

- Use codelabs to build and test your own agent.

- Explore the Tools folder to see reusable code patterns.

- By Day 5, you will be able to construct a multi-agent system and deploy it.
